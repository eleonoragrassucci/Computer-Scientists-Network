# HW4

The repository has three files:

The file Modules.py contains the function we used;

The file Report.pdf contains the results we obtained.

As soon as we load the file on Python we created a dictionary with the ids of the author as keys in order to create a graph where each author id was a node and each edge was a publication the two nodes shared.
