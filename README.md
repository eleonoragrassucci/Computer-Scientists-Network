# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining Homework 4

The repository has three files:

The file Modules.py contains the functions we used;

The file Program.py contains the code we used to execute the program;

The file Report.pdf contains the results we obtained.

As soon as we load the file on Python, with the createDict function, we created 4 dictionaries with all the informations that we are going to use. Maybe some of them are useless, but we prefered to have them for versatility. First we created a dictionary, authors_dict, with the ids of the authors as keys in order to create a graph where each author's id is a node and each edge is a publication that two nodes shared. The structure is: {author_id: [author_name,[list of tuples(publication_id,publication_id_int)],[list of tuples(conference_id,conference_id_int)]]}. The second dictionary is authors_dict_reference which associates to each author_name his author id. The third dictionary is publications_dict that associates to each pubblication a list of the author_id 's that participated to that pubblication. The last dictionary is conferences_dict that associates to each conference_id a list of the publication_id that were part of it. We prefered using dictionaries because they are fast and usefull to retrive a desired information.
To create the graph we used the function createGraph where each node has as attributes the name of the author, the list of the publications he/she has done, the conferences where he/she has taken part of. 
Instead, each edge has one attribute, the weight evaluated as 1 - Jaccard distance between the two authors.
The function Jaccard calulates the Jaccard distance where the numerator is the intersection between the two authors and the denominator is the union between them.
While we are creating the graph, we create a dictionary similar that, if a node has distance 0 from another, it means that they are identical, so we associate for each group of similar nodes, one of them that will rappressent the group. We will use this for the third part. 

### 2 a.

In this point, given in input a conference, we return the induced subgraph with the authors who published in that event. To do it, we copied the graph G and then removed the nodes that did not published at the input conference. Once we created the graph, we evaluated some centrality measures using the networkx functions: Degree, Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality.
Check the .pdf file to see the results and the plots.

### 2 b.

Here, we wrote a function named neighbors to evaluate the hop distance from Aris.
This function saves into a list "to_visit" the neighbors of the nodes it visits and then it takes the node to visit into account. It repeats these steps until the d-distance set from the input.
In particular, as you can see in the pdf file, this function is faster than the newtorkx one.

### 3

To make everything faster, we want to make a smaller graph without loosing any information. First we removed the isolated nodes, because, since we have to work on the distance between two nodes, we already know that the distance between any node and a isolated one doesn't exixt (since the nodes can't be connected). Then, by using the similar dictionary, we removed every node, except for one, from every group of identical nodes. We did this because the distance between any node and two identical node is the same. So if you have one distance, you automatically have even the second distance. This procedure reduces the complexity of the graph.

To calculate the shortest distance between any couple of nodes, we used Dijkstra algorithm, that gives in output a dictionary of the shortest path lenghts between one node and all the other ones. To make everyhting really fast we used the heapq library with the heap structure.
Dijkstra algorithm consists in: 
Let the node at which we are starting be called the initial node. Let the distance of node Y be the distance from the initial node to Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.
1. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.
2. Set the initial node as current. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.
3. For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B (through A) will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.
4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and go back to step 3.

### 3.a

Here we used the function distances_aris, that by recalling the Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the shortest path length from Aris to every other node that is connected to him. We give as output the distance between the node given in input and Aris. Since we took out a few nodes, we always have to check if the node that we ask in input doesn't exist or was removed. If it was removed, then we look at it as if it is the node that we kept from it's identical group. Or it was an isolated node, so the nodes weren't connected.

### 3.b

Here we want to return  for each node of the graph, its GroupNumber, defined as follows: GroupNumber(v) = min(uâˆˆI)
{ShortestPath(v,u)}, where v is a node in the graph and I is the set of input nodes. We ask as input a list of author ids but we acept at most 21 of them. At first we compute the dijkstra algorithm for all the nodes in the list, so at most 21 times. This way we avoid the calculation of the shortest path of all the possible node combinations. After we compute all the necessary dijkstras we just need to read dictionaries. Here we create a dictionary called GROUP_NUMBER where as keys we have a graph of the node and as value a tuple where the first element is the node from the list that is closest to him and as second value it's distance from that node. It may happen that a node isn't connected in any way to any of the nodes in the input list.
